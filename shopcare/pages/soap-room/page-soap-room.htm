      <p>Each year we make more than four tonnes of soap by hand at the Perfumery. That's a lot of soap! And when you consider that each 100g bar is then lovingly wrapped by hand, you can see that we spend a lot of time in the Soap Room.</p>

      <h3>Cutting<br>and Drying</h3>
      <p>There is native area for those meadow herbs such as Meadow Sweet (used to sweeten apple sauces, pies and jams), Lady's Bedstraw (used as a strewing herb to lay down in houses against bad smells, also used to stuff pillows and mattresses) and Oregano (a wonderful seasoning for stews and soups).</p>

      <h3><br>Wrapping</h3>
      <p>Many of the abundant plants that grow along the roadsides and in the fields of the Burren are in fact medicinal or cosmetic herbs which have many uses long since forgotten. The garden was laid out to reflect those different usages.</p>

      <h2>Cold Soap Making</h2>
      <p><em>The soaps we make at the Burren Perfumery are mainly made using what is known as the cold process.</em></p>
      <p><em>Cold process soap is made by mixing oils and lye (sodium hydroxide) at a certain temperature such that the (acid) fats chemically combine with the (base) lye and saponify into soup (a salt).</em></p>
