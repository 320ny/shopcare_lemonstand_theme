    <h3>Shopping Online</h3>
    <p>Pretty much everything we make at the Perfumery can be ordered from our website, we ship all over the world and our organic creams and balms <strong class="bold">ship for free</strong>. Orders are normally packaged and on their way within 2 to 3 days.</p>
    <p>If you have any special requests, or need to make changes to your order we are happy to do so (as long as it hasn't shipped obviously). You can talk to our shop staff (yes, a real person) by calling <strong class="bold">+353 65 7089102</strong> or email us at <strong><a href="mailto:orders@burrenperfumery.com" target="_blank">orders@burrenperfumery.com</a></strong> if you have any questions.</p>

      <h4>Offers</h4>
      <p>The best way to learn about special offers is to subscribe to our newsletter. We send an email newsletter at most three times a year, though in recent years we've only managed once a year because we've been so busy! When you sign up, the initial email includes an offer code giving you 10% off your first order.</p>
      <p>Include <strong>newsletters@burrenperfumery.com</strong> in your address book or check your junk mail folder if you don't get this first email. It's pretty hard to get any sort of email with the words "special offer" through these days!</p>
      <p>No matter how busy we are, we always send a newsletter around the first week of November, with articles about the Perfumery and special offers for the holiday season.</p>

    <div class="shipping-rates">
      <h4>Shipping Rates</h4>
      <p>We charge shipping by weight. Organic products from our range of creams and balms ship free, so these products don't count toward the weight of your parcel. If your orders consists of only organic products shipping will be completely free. If it includes other products you will only be charged for the cost of shipping the non-organic products.</p>
      <p>We use GLS for most of our European shipping including Britain and Ireland. Occasionally, if a package is very small, we will use conventional post instead. For destinations outside Europe we use international air mail.</p>
      <h4 class="travel-times">Travel Times</h4>
      <p>
        Ireland 1-3 working days<br>
        UK 2-5 working days<br>
        Europe 3-7 working days<br>
        USA &amp; Canada 5-10 working days<br>
        Australia 5-10 working days

    <div class="security">
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>We use a large and well-known e-commerce platform for the secure part of our online shopping. Credit card details are retained for seven days by the provider then deleted. We are aware that this can be inconvenient for frequent shoppers, but it ensures that should there ever be a security breach at the e-commerce provider only the details of the most recent orders are at risk.</p>
      <p>We have now added the option to use Paypal to pay for your order. If you already have a Paypal account, you're all set. If you're not familiar with Paypal, Paypal is a very popular and secure way to make and receive payments online. Once you have your Paypal account setup, your address and payment details are all stored by Paypal, saving you the trouble of having to key them in each time you make a purchase.</p>
