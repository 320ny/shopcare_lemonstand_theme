    <h3>Location and Directions</h3>
    <p>The Burren Perfumery is located in the heart of the beautiful and dramatic landscape of the Burren, in the West of Ireland. We're 2km from Carran (also signed as: Carron), in the centre of the Burren, Co. Clare. The nearest towns are Kinvara (to the North East), Ballyvaghan (to the North West), Corrofin (to the South) and Ennistymon (to the South West).</p>
    <p>We're about a one hour drive from Galway City, an hour from Shannon Airport, 45 minutes from the Cliffs of Moher. If you're driving in Ireland for the first time, bear in mind that though the distances are short, the roads are often narrow and winding and progress can be slow.</p>
