      <em>Dedicated to the beautiful flora of the Burren.</em>
      <p>The Burren Perfumery Organic Herb Garden was planted in 1999. Our intention is to provide our visitors with examples of native herbs and information on their traditional uses. The garden also contains a number of small, secluded areas where people can sit and relax in the quiet of the Burren. The Herb Garden is free to visitors and open year round. The best time to visit is from May to September.</p>

      <h3>Fresh from<br>the meadow</h3>
      <p>There is native area for those meadow herbs such as Meadow Sweet (used to sweeten apple sauces, pies and jams), Lady's Bedstraw (used as a strewing herb to lay down in houses against bad smells, also used to stuff pillows and mattresses) and Oregano (a wonderful seasoning for stews and soups).</p>

      <h3>Making you<br>beautiful</h3>
      <p>Many of the abundant plants that grow along the roadside and in the fields of the Burrent are in fact medicinal or cosmetic herbs which have many uses long since forgotten. The garden was laid out to reflect those different usages.</p>
